Protect your apps with <strong>Face ID, Touch ID or passcode</strong>!<br>
<br>
- Add stylish protection to your applications and many other protectable items and prevent opening them unless you authenticate using your Face ID or Touch ID! (or enter a passcode, in devices that don't support Touch ID)<br>
<br>
- The most secure and yet fastest way to protect your applications, presented with a very cool UI.<br>
<br>
- Touch ID needs less than a second to verify a correctly added fingerprint!<br>
<br>
- Face ID needs even less!<br>
<br>
The tweak listens to application launch events or other protected items events and blocks them if they are listed as protected until you enter your Touch ID (or passcode)!<br>
<br>
You can configure it to protect access to applications, folders, settings panes, flipswitches, control center items, power down, SIM unlock and more!<br>
<br>
You can set a passcode as an alternative protection method (or as the only method in devices without TouchID sensor). The passcode is different than your device's passcode! (or you could use the same)<br>
<br>
Enjoy the fastest and yet most secure protection!<br>
